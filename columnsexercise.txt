Div 1 and 2 are shorter and the gray border is longer. The divs were 350 and now they are about 310.
They both move to the right but stay around 300px each, next to each other instead of one on top of the other.
Both of the divs move to the left of the screen,next to each other instead of on top.
They stay the same size, but Div2 is cut off a little bit. They remain next to each other.
Div1 moves right and Div2 moves left.
Div1 is as wide as the whole page. Div2 stays the same size and moves below Div1.
The Divs stay next to each other and don't get cut off.
The Divs were smaller so they could both fit but they did not get cut off.
